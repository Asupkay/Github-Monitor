# GitHub Monitor
This application is meant to monitor all GitHub repositories of a user in realtime and display updates

## How To Start
First `npm i` in both the base folder and the client folder. To run in dev mode do `npm run-script dev` to run in production `npm start`. The webhooks will not work on localhost due to GitHub needing to point to an ip with ssl. (Yeah we actually have SSL).
